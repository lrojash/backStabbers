### Overview

The website allows for users to display their true feelings about ideas and subjects, without the judgement from outside viewers. The idea of the site is to function like twitter where any posts that are made are only visible to the user and the followers alike. There is no censorship, nor judgment. Accept only those that can stand your sense of humor and share your ideas. A disclosure is displayed during signup and through the user experience, stating to do their own research with news articles that may be displayed or shared by other users.
